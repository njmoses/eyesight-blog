        <h2>Self-Improvement vs. Self-Acceptance: The Perspective of an Entrepreneurial Millennial</h2>
          <p>What would you do if you developed a disorder that you were going to live with for the rest of your life? Would you accept it and cope with the struggles on a daily basis? Or, would you dedicate your time to developing a cure or a means of improving your life?<br><br>

You see, we as millennials have access to an infinite number of ways to educate ourselves and others, and to create things with merely the click of a button. Yet, we are a generation that rarely seeks self-improvement when we are faced with a personal challenge. Rather, we often settle with self-acceptance. Both of which are significant, but a balance between the two is needed. You cannot improve yourself without the desire for acceptance, and you cannot accept yourself without the action of improvement.<br> <br>

Since we were born, our parents have told us that we are great the way we are. Everybody got a trophy. We didn’t even keep score until we were ten years old. We have been living in a society where it is okay--rather, encouraged-- to be an individual. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this.<br><br>

This past June, I had an existential thought process that lasted a couple of days. It seemed to me as if, throughout our lives, we developed a means of accepting a tough situation, classifying it as “the way things are”, instead of taking action to change or improve it. Upon graduating from this existential journey, I made it a goal of mine to take action to solve any and all problems that come my way. Since then, I have been inspired by people who lead self-revolutions in fixing their own world, especially Thomas Kehoe, who I had the pleasure of meeting three weeks ago.<br><br>

Thomas has dealt with a severe stutter since he was young, and has spent twenty-three years building the technology for others who stutter to improve their speech. When the user places the device’s headphones in their ears, they will hear their voice differently in their head. Ultimately, this allows them to improve their speech starting immediately. <br><br>

Thomas is the definition of a true entrepreneur. <br><br>

He did not start his company for the money, or the fame, or the glamour. He started his company because he had to. He needed the solution to a problem that nobody had solved. Before developing his product, Thomas became the smartest, most athletic person that he knew by diving deeper into his education and working harder than others. While earning his MBA at the University of Chicago, he attended all of the recruiting events, where he met hundreds of Fortune 500 executives. It occurred to him that they were no smarter than he was. <br><br>

In my opinion, the belief that you have complete power over the way your life unfolds is one of the single-most necessary factors of being an entrepreneur. This is known as an internal locus of control. <br><br>

One of my biggest goals is to contribute significantly to shaping a generation filled with forward-thinking, motivated and innovative individuals. So, here is the call to action: <br><br>

Get up and go! <br><br>

No matter how big or small your problem may be that is holding you back today, turn off the screen that you are looking at, stand up, and take that first step. <br><br>

For anyone who shares my belief, or is currently taking action to fix a problem, please reach out to me. Let’s start an open discussion about self-improvement and self-acceptance. <br><br>

Who knows where it will lead... <br><br>
